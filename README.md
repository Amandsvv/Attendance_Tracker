## 📘 Project Overview
The **Attendance Tracker** is a simple and efficient **command-line Python application** designed to help users record and manage student attendance in real-time.  
It allows users to:

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. The program prompts the user to enter the total number of students.  
2. For each student, the user enters:
   - Student name  
   - Check-in time (e.g., `09:15 AM`)  
3. The tracker ensures:
   - Names and times are not empty  
   - Duplicate names are not allowed  
4. Once all records are entered, a summary table is displayed.  
5. The user can choose to save the attendance record to a file.
